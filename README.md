# Turing machine simulator
A Turing machine simulator written in Python.

Programs are written as quintuples in the format <current_state>, <current_symbol>, <next_state>, <next_symbol>, <direction>. Delineators are unnecessary (but should be used anyway for readability's sake).

Features:
- Choose from either continuous run or stepping
- Choose from line-by-line or live display
- Set or disable step delay
- See number of steps, number of head moves and state path
